# Gaussian Process

My aim is to provide an implementation of [Gaussian Process Regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_process) in Rust, to be used as a building block for other algorithms (such as [Bayesian Optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_optimization)).

**This crate is still in its alpha stage, the interface and internals might still evolve significantly.**

## Usage



## TODO

- Clean-up the documentation.
- Add better algorithms to fit kernel parameters.
- Add ndarray support behind a feature flag

*Do not hesitate to send pull request or ask for features.*
